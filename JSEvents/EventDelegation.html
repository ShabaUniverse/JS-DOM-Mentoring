<!-- When you click any <li> element inside the <ul> element with the id menu, 
the click event bubbles to the parent element which is the <ul> element. 

So instead of handling the click event of the individual <li> element, 
you can capture the click event at the parent element. 
 
In the click event listener, you can access the target property which references 
the element that dispatches the event. To get the id of the element that the event actually fires, 
you use the target.id property. 

Once having the id of the element that fires the click event, 
you can have code that handles the event correspondingly.  -->
