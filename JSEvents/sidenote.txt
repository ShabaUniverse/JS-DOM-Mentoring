------------------Intro to Events------------------------
Use addEventListener() to register an event that connects an event to an event listener
The event object is accessible only within the event listener.
Use preventDefault() method to prevent the default behavior of an event, but does not stop the event flow.
Use stopPropagation() method to stop the flow of an event through the DOM tree, 
but does not cancel the browser default behavior.


------------------Handling Events----------------------

There are three ways to assign an event handler: HTML event handler attribute, 
element’s event handler property, and addEventListener().
Assign an event handler via the HTML event handler attribute should be avoided.

-----------------Mouse Events---------------------------

The "mousedown" fires when you depress the mouse button on the element.
The "mouseup" fires when you release the mouse button on the element.
The "click" fires when one mousedown and one mouseup detected on the element.
The "dblclick" event fires when you double click over an element.
The "mousemove" event fires repeatedly when you move the mouse cursor around an element

The "mouseover" fires when the mouse cursor is outside of the element and then move to inside 
the boundaries of the element.

The "mouseout" fires when the mouse cursor is over an element and then moves another element.

The mouseenter fires when the mouse cursor is outside of an element and 
then moves to inside the boundaries of the element.

The mouseleave fires when the mouse cursor is over an element and 
then moves to the outside of the element’s boundaries.

Both mouseenter and mouseleave does not bubble and does not fire 
when the mouse cursor moves over descendant elements.

---Detecting Mouse Buttons: 
0: the main mouse button is pressed, usually the left button.
1: the auxiliary button is pressed, usually the middle button or the wheel button.
2: the secondary button is pressed, usually the right button.
3: the fourth button is pressed, usually the Browser Back button.
4: the fifth button is pressed, usually the Browser Forward button.


---Getting screen coordinates: 

The screenX and screenY properties of the event passed to the mouse event handler return the screen 
coordinates of the location of the mouse in relation to the entire screen.

On the other hand, the clientX and clientY properties provide the horizontal and vertical 
coordinates within the application’s client area at which the mouse event occurred

---Summary of MouseEvents

Use addEventListener() method to register a mouse event handler.

The event.button indicates which mouse button was pressed to trigger the mouse event.

The modifier keys: alt, shift, ctrl, and meta (Mac) can be obtained 
via properties of the event object passed to the mouse event handler.

The screenX and screenY properties return the horizontal and 
vertical coordinates of the mouse pointer in screen coordinates.

The clientX and clientY properties of the event object return horizontal and vertical coordinates 
within the application’s client area at which the mouse event occurred.

------------------------Keyboard Events------------------------

When you press a character key on the keyboard, the keydown, keypress, 
and keyup events are fired sequentially. However, 
if you press a non-character key, only the keydown and keyup events are fired.

The keyboard event object has two important properties: 
key and code  properties that allow you to detect which key has been pressed.

The key property returns the value of the key pressed 
while the code represents a physical key on the keyboard.

-------------------Scroll Events------------------------------------------

The scroll event fires when you scroll a webpage or an element.
For a page, the scrollX and scrollY properties return the number of pixels 
that the document is currently scrolled horizontally and vertically.

For an element, the scrollTop and scrollLeft properties set or get the number 
of pixels that the element’s content is vertically scrolled and scrolled from its left edge.

Use the event throttling technique to better handle the scroll events. 
In modern web browsers, you can use passive event listeners.


--------------------Focus Events----------------------------------

The focus events fire when an element receives or loses focus. These are the two main focus events:

focus fires when an element has received focus.
blur fires when an element has lost focus.

The window gains focus when you bring it forward by using Alt+Tab or 
clicking on it and loses focus when you send it back.

Links when you use a mouse or a keyboard.

Form fields like input text when you use a keyboard or a mouse.

Elements with tabindex, also when you use a keyboard or a mouse.

----------------------Hashchange Events-----------------------

The hashchange event fires when the URL hash changed.

To register an event listener, you call the addEventListener() 
method or assign an event listener to the onhashchange property of the window object.

----------------------Event Delegation------------------------

----JavaScript event delegation benefits
When it is possible, you can have a single event handler on the document 
that will handle all the events of a particular type. By doing this, you gain the following benefits:

Less memory usage, better performance.

Less time required to set up event handlers on the page.

The document object is available immediately. As long as the element is rendered, 
it can start functioning correctly without delay. You don’t need to wait for the DOMContentLoaded or load events.

-----Summary
Having a large number of event handlers will take up memory and degrade the performance of a page.

The event delegation technique utilizes the event bubbling to handle event at a higher 
level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated.


-------------------------------Custom Events-------------------------------

The custom events allow you to decouple the code that you want to execute 
after another piece of code completes. For example, 
you can separate the event listeners in a separate script. In addition, 
you can have multiple event listeners to the same custom event.

-----------------------------Dispatch Event-------------------------------

bubbles - means that element might be spread up by hierarchy;
something like this:
html - body - div - ul - li - a
if you click on 'a' then it will spread up to li,ul, etc;
